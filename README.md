# rust-bitcoin-journey

A structured learning and contribution repository documenting my journey toward becoming a high-impact contributor to the Rust Bitcoin ecosystem, with a focus on code comprehension, Rust fundamentals, and open-source workflow mastery.

## Purpose

This repository exists to systematically prepare me for meaningful contributions to major Rust Bitcoin projects—particularly rust-bitcoin:

  Deeply understanding Rust fundamentals in real-world codebases
  Learning how large, security-critical open-source projects are structured
  Practicing open-source workflows (issues, branches, PRs, reviews)
  Building the habits and discipline expected of long-term maintainers

This is not a tutorial repo and not a collection of random experiments.
It is a deliberate, documented learning path aligned with professional open-source contribution standards.

## Long-Term Goal

By March 2026, I aim to:

  Confidently navigate the rust-bitcoin codebases
  Understand how Bitcoin primitives are modeled in Rust
  Contribute production-quality pull requests that maintainers can trust
  Become a consistent, reliable contributor in the Rust Bitcoin ecosystem

## Repository Structure

├── notes/           # Learning notes from reading Rust & Bitcoin codebases
├── exercises/       # Targeted Rust practice inspired by real Bitcoin code
├── contributions/   # Work-in-progress PRs, issue investigations, and patches
└── journal.md       # Daily learning log and progress tracking

### notes/

  Concept explanations in my own words
  Codebase navigation notes
  Rust concepts as they appear in Bitcoin code (ownership, enums, error handling)
  Maintainer-style observations and design insights

### exercises/

Rust exercises derived from real patterns in rust-bitcoin
  Focus on:
    Structs and enums
    Ownership and borrowing
    Error handling with Result
    Immutability and safety
    
 No “toy” examples unless they map to real Bitcoin concepts

### contributions/

  Draft PRs and patch experiments
  Issue breakdowns and root-cause analysis
  Notes on review feedback and lessons learned
  A staging area before submitting upstream contributions

### journal.md

  Daily progress log
  What was studied, what was confusing, what improved
  Reflection on mistakes and breakthroughs
  Accountability record for long-term consistency

## Learning Philosophy

This repository follows a maintainer-first learning approach:

  Read code before writing code
  Understand intent before syntax
  Prefer small, correct contributions over large, risky ones
  Optimize for clarity, safety, and long-term maintainability

I focus on how Rust is used to prevent invalid Bitcoin states, not just how to make the compiler happy.

## Tools & Stack

  Language: Rust
  Version Control: Git & GitHub
  Primary Codebases Studied:

rust-bitcoin
  Workflow: Fork → Branch → Pull Request → Review → Iterate


## Status

Active / In Progress

This repository evolves continuously as my understanding deepens and as I move from reading code → writing code → contributing upstream.

##  Notes for Maintainers & Reviewers

If you are a maintainer or experienced contributor reading this repository:

  This repo reflects my learning process, not final production code
  Mistakes and misunderstandings are intentionally documented
  Feedback, corrections, and guidance are welcome and appreciated

The goal is long-term contribution quality, not short-term perfection.

##  Closing Note

Bitcoin is too important for shallow understanding.

This repository represents a commitment to:

  Technical excellence
  Open-source responsibility
  Continuous learning
  Community-first contribution
