Baseline Transaction Model

This commit represents the initial, naive implementation of a Bitcoin
transaction model written during my rust-bitcoin learning journey.

Purpose of this baseline:
- Capture first-principles understanding of Bitcoin transactions
- Serve as a reference point for future refactors
- Enable comparison between naive and refined designs

This code intentionally:
- Uses simple data types (e.g., String)
- Does not enforce strong invariants
- Prioritizes readability over correctness

All future improvements will build incrementally on top of this baseline.
